# aurelia-test-karma-bones

This repo was built from scratch, to determine the minimum set of dependencies and configuration
necessary to run Jasmine tests with Karama, on an Aurelia project bundled with Webpack.

At the moment the only 1 of the 2 tests will run.
The asynchronous test currently fails to return and is being investigated.

## Running The Tests

	npx karma start
